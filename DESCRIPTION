Description: birdproofr is a package of R tools for bird banding data validation under a set of rules written by Heidi Ware Carlisle, Intermountain Bird Observatory. The validator can be ran as a Shiny app for convenience, which includes utilities for viewing and downloading flagged data. Individual attributes can also be validated through function calls from the R console - please see IBO ruleset. The current birdproofr build has been updated for Fall 2018 banding. Support for a hummingbird ruleset is planned.
